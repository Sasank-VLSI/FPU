- IC Compiler II
- PrimeTime

## Technology Details
- **Node**: 14nm
- **Metal Layers**: 8
- **Instance Count**: ~125K

## Key Contributions
- Performed **RTL synthesis** and timing optimization using Design Compiler.
- Designed optimized **floorplan** achieving 62% utilization.
- Conducted **macro placement** based on fly-line and hierarchy analysis.
- Created **placement and routing blockages** to reduce congestion.
- Performed **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** and resolved violations.
